<p>People performance is a hot potato*. </p>
<p>But it is a powerful topic if it can be approached with a structured and intellectually honest manner. Most of us want to perform and are keen on understanding how to do it. But many hate the ambiguity that often comes with performance.   </p>
<p>I've found that we often don't have a good definition of what people's performance actually is. One problem that I've come to learn is that we aren't distinguishing performance and results enough. I get it, in the end results are what matters. It makes it easy to fall into the trap of seeing results as a good metric for performance. </p>
<p>The problem with results is that they are many times not completely attributable to an individual's performance. More often than not success is dependent on external factors and real results are often a messy process. Many successful creative persons will attest to the fact that suceeding is actually failing and continuing. Additionally results often come late in the journey. So if you tie performance to results, then it’s hard to do something about the process of performing. Which is in fact the thing we often want to optimize.</p>
<p>There are plenty of analogies to exemplify the difference of performance and results. An athlete can have a great performance (take a lot of passes, run a lot of miles), but may still not win a medal because their competitors performed better. A microservice can process millions of messages per second, but the result may still not make it to the end user. So some things can perform very well and still not have the impact one wants. But it is through the process of performance that results will come, eventually. </p>
<p>So how can we look at performance in order to make it more straight forward?</p>
<p>One way is to think of performance as the rate of which progress gets made. And long term performance as the rate of progress over a long time. This applies well to a soccer player whose performance can be measured in number of passes in a game, miles run, ball touches and shots on goal. If a player has these stats in a game, you will likely recognize it as a good game on an individual level, often independent of how the game ends. Similarly, low performance is often passive, indecisive and lacks energy.</p>
<p>In knowledge work, where many of us spend our time, this model can also be applied. A person that completes significant tasks every week versus one that does so every month is performing differently. Both can yield good results, but one performs better than the other because of the continuous forward motion. I've also experienced that continuous, frequent, transparent completion of tasks is also intrinsically rewarding for the individual and motivating for the entire system's flow. If one part moves fast it's likely that others will want to pick up the pace. If not, they might run the risk of being visible points of friction for overall progress.</p>
<p>Now, you might think that not all tasks can be completed in lets say a week. It is natural that different roles have different types of tasks and some jobs are more complicated than others. But this emphasizes this point in a great way. Because a necessary part of high performance is the ability to break down tasks to a size that is possible to complete timely. I would argue that any job or mission can and should be broken down to tasks that can be handled in, say a week. This is true for the complex process of fundraising, to building a feature and to making a sale. All jobs can be broken down into smaller tasks and milestones. </p>
<p>Thinking about performance in this way, and focusing on task completion time as a measurement of “performance”, allows you to see the system clearly and act if you want to. 
Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can identify high performance by identifying those with the quickest and most consistent rate of delivery.  At the same time you can clearly tell if another part of the system is not delivering at a similar pace and have a discussion about that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can learn what contributes high and lower performance by looking at flow and friction. For example by getting feedback from people, and apply fixes to the environment or behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can understand your role as a leader in creating an environment that enables performance. Such as providing direction and priorities so people don't have to work on multiple things at the same time. Or to remove blockers and dependencies that keep your team from not being able to finish their tasks, which results in low performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most importantly you can define, with your peers, what good and excellent performance is, and be consistent, honest and fair. Maybe set weekly progress as a bar for high performance. Look at weak performance when delivery rate causes external problems. Ok performance when important things get done last minute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what about rewarding results? This is also very important. A person that operates with high performance that also has a tendency to be involved in great results is a great candidate for promotion. You will likely want this person to have greater influence. One added benefit is that you’ll be able to tell when someone needs support because it will likely show when their delivery rate goes down.</p>
<p>So what about reviewing against job responsibilities? It is also important, but I think that a person who is not meeting their responsibilities will have a hard time delivering frequently. Or they need a change of job.</p>
<p>Finally, there are also other aspects to people's performance. Such as those that can be understood from peer feedback and 360 reviews. But my finding is that the data gathered through those often tell us how well someone supports the flow and health of the team. If someone is impacting the mood, delivery rate and flow of the team around them it will be discoverable with this metric. </p>
<p>I realize that not all cultures want to have this focus on performance, but those that do might benefit from a structured approach like this. </p>
<p>** Interestingly, often those that hate the word performance are either those that already perform well or those that aren't. My finding is that many of us fall in the middle and would benefit from knowing more about what to optimize to get to high performance. So this is a post that touches on this topic with the interest in providing a nudge on how to think about it.</p>
